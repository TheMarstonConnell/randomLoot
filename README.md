# RandomLoot 2

This is the source for the Minecraft mod RandomLoot 2. RL2 is the continuation and subsequent rewrite of the [Random Loot Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/random-loot-mod). RL2 was rewritten from the ground up to support Minecraft 1.20.x with the goals of creating an easier to maintain code-base with an expandable modifier system.
