# RandomLoot 2

**RandomLoot 2** is the continuation and subsequent rewrite of the [Random Loot Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/random-loot-mod). RL2 was rewritten from the ground up to support Minecraft 1.20.x with the goals of creating an easier to maintain code-base with an expandable modifier system.

## Items
This mod adds two items, the Loot Case and the Random Tool. You'll never see the Random Tool called the Random Tool since every tool is randomly generated and uniquely named.

### Loot Case
You can find cases in any chest that generated in a structure of some kind (ex: dungeons, mineshafts, buried treasure). There is a 25% chance that opening a chest yields a case. Right-clicking with this case generates a new tool and removes the case from your inventory.

### Random Tool
Random Tools look like a variety of tool types and can be one of: pickaxes, shovels, axes, swords. These tools all generate with random traits. For every tool you generate by opening a case, the tool you generate will come with better stats and more traits.

Holding Shift while hovering over tools will give you an expanded view on details about the tool and current status of traits.

Holding Control (command on a mac) while hovering over tools will give you a description of every trait currently applied to the tool.
